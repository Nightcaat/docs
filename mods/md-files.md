# `about.md`

Geode mods can specify a long, free-form description typeset using Markdown by including a file named `about.md` at the root of their project. See [the MDTextArea class](/classes/geode/MDTextArea) for information on what features of Markdown are supported.

This file is similar to a README, however **it's intended for people who use the mod**; you should also keep a README for developers interested in building / contributing to your mod.

## Example

```md
# My Awesome Mod

This is my awesome mod, that does **all** the awesome stuff!

If you like this mod, please check [my other mod](mod:my.other-mod)!

# `changelog.md`

You may also provide a markdown file that contains a changelog for your mod. Geode uses this file to show release notes for the mod.

```md
# v1.1.0

 * Removed Herobrine

# v1.0.1

 * Fixed bugs

# v1.0.0

 * Initial release
```

# `support.md`

You may also provide a markdown file that contains free-form information about how to support you, the mod's developer. This may include things like Patreon links, PayPal links, catgirl picture donation links, anything you wish to say!
